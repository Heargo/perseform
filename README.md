## Use changeset to create a new version

To create a new version of the package, you need to use the `changeset` tool. To do that, you need to run the following command:

```bash
npm run update
```

This will open an interactive prompt where you can select the type of change you want to make (major, minor, patch) and write a description of the changes you made. After that, the tool will create a new file in the `.changeset` folder with the changes you made.
